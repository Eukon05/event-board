# Event Board

- Project start: 30.05.2023
- Project goal: Improve my ability to write clean and maintainable code, by utilising "hexagonal architecture" and TDD
- Additional goals: Learn Gradle

## Features

- Users can perform standard CRUD operations on events
- Events can be public or private - private events can only be viewed by people that the organizer has invited, or that
  other guests have invited, while public events can be searched for by everyone
- Users can become friends, which allows them to invite each-other to events
- The app is integrated with Keycloak, an OAuth2 authentication server, which allows users to log-in using their social
  media accounts
- The API's documentation can be viewed easily, thanks to OpenAPI's SwaggerUI
